# Unit economics in OPIA FOOD

Opia Food is the first food marketplace on Telegram, which is part of the overall Opia World system. Opia Food includes all the above cases, offline and online purchases, as well as future Opia POS.

**Unit economics** is the assessment of a business's financial performance by analyzing revenue, costs, and productivity at the individual product or customer level.

**Data now (Without marketplace and without POS)**

**CPA** reduction for the following reasons:

- Time spent on product development. Because of this, the payback period and the cost of attracting one client have increased. After the release of the version, **the indicator will change and the unit economy will look more attractive.**

**LTV** (Customer lifetime value) will increase for the following reasons:

- **more than 80% of clients** plan to use all available Opia World cases in their establishments

- clients will start using an **additional type of payment (offline)**. This functionality is not yet provided by any food delivery platform.

- **organic growth at current rates**. The growth rate is maintained in each case. This affects purchase conversion, customer engagement and return.
