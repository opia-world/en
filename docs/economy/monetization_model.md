# Monetization model

_What types of monetization does "Opia World" use?_

## Commission-based model

The company receives a commission for each order that occurs on the platform. For example, if a customer purchases a product or service, the company receives a percentage of the purchase amount as a commission.

This monetization model allows the OPIA WORLD to earn money without the need to sell its own products or services.

## Blockchain Transaction model. {::nomarkdown} <font color="green">"Planned model (Hypothesis)"</font> {:/}

It's a monetization model where revenue is generated based on each transaction in the network that can represent any activity within an ecosystem. For example, purchases, transfers, conversions, or other interactions.

This model is commonly used in various industries, including crypto, e-commerce, fintech, and digital marketplaces, and allows businesses to directly tie their revenue to the volume or value of transactions processed on their platform.
