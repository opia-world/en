**Impact on key metrics:**
- _The average time that OPIA allows you **to save is 7-10 minutes per order**_
- _The purchasing process via messenger has been simplified. The client prefers Telegram to sites or services for ordering food because of convenience_
- _**For every 10 users, 4 do not place an order** due to distrust of payments within the messenger, **but this figure decreases from month to month**, which indicates an increase in trust in messengers_
- _**Every third user leaves a comment after ordering**_
- _The return rate of customers through Opia is higher than through the website or food delivery applications. **Now it is around 70%**, in contrast to 30% in delivery services and 45% on the website_
